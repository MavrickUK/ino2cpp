Convert Arduino INO sketches to C++ by creating new .cpp and .h files


## Details

Arduino sketches and C++ are very similar.
However, an INO file cannot be compiled as-is by C/C++ compilers (e.g. GCC).
This tool converts INO sketches to C++ code such that off-the-shelf compilers and static analysis tools can be executed on the code.

## Converter
There are three steps in this conversion [1][2]:****
1. **Generate forward declarations**. Arduino INO sketches allow the use of a function before its definition. The first step is to parse the INO sketch to obtain function signatures, and generate a header file with these signatures ("sketch_name.h").
2. **Includes**. Two includes are inserted before the content of the INO sketch: #include <Arduino.h>, and #include "sketch_name.h".
3. **Write C++ to disk**. Write the resulting C++ and header file to disk. INO is unchanged!

## Installation
Portable, just download the latest release version and run the .exe from where you unzipped.
**Or** you can use **Scoop** package manager and install with:
1. Install [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop)
2. Add this bucket to scoop:
```bash
scoop bucket add ino2cpp https://github.com/MavrickUK/ino2cpp
```
3. Install tools via `scoop install`:
```bash
scoop install ino2cpp
```
4. You're done.
## Usage
```
ino2cpp <filename> [-o <filename>] [-v]
ino2cpp uno_led.ino
ino2cpp -h
```

## Example
```
âžœ .\ino2cpp.exe uno_led.ino -v
Ino2Cpp Converter v0.2
Working, please wait...
  void update_started();
  void update_finished();
  void update_progress(int cur, int total);
  void update_error(int err);
  void otaUpdate(String url);
  void check_for_updates();
Funcs exported: 6
Added: #include <Arduino.h> and #include "uno_led.h" to uno_led.cpp
uno_led.cpp and uno_led.h created. Done!
```
